# Glacial mass balance projects 

Repository to hold files for an ongoing project to model September mass balance using non-linear neural networks and computational glaciology projects. 

To do: 

- Fix seasonal splitting function
- Add PyTorch version of the model
- Add Jupyter NB for demoing functions and model

Data was accessed and functions in the data preparation and plotting scripts were written using the OGGM documentation.
